# Representation-Learning-Project

Enhanced Multi-Condition ControlNet for Generative Image Synthesis 
Supervised By : Chair of Image Data Exploration and Analysis

Tasks done in this project :
• Extended ControlNet to handle dual conditioning for fine-grained text-to-image generation; trained on 25K+
ADE20K samples using V100/A100 GPUs with efficient convergence; leveraged BLIP models for automated im-
age captioning.
• Designed a custom evaluation metric to quantify conditional influence via pixel-level analysis.
